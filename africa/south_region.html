                    Since the Neolithic Period, the mountain kingdom was the domain of Khoisan-speaking hunter-gatherers.

                    until it became a British protectorate, one of three British High Commission Territories (the others 
                    being Bechuanaland [now Botswana] and Swaziland).</td>
