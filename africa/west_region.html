    <p>West Africa refers to the countries north of the Gulf of Guinea in the north-western part of the continent. 
       It is located in the southern part of the so-called hump of Africa; it is bounded in the north by the Sahara 
       desert and the Sahel zone.
       <br>
       <br>
       There are sixteen (16) countries in West Africa and one (1) British Overseas Territory, Saint Helena. According to 
       the United Nations Population Division, an estimated 412 million people live in West Africa (in 2021).
